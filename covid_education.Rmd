### Clean Covid Data from 2020 - 2022

Format data according to "Spatial correlations in geographical spreading of COVID‐19 in the United States". 

```{r}
# are there any NA's?
print("NA count per column 2020")
print(sapply(covid2020_raw, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))
print("NA count per column 2021")
print(sapply(covid2021_raw, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))
print("NA count per column 2022")
print(sapply(covid2022_raw, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))
```

```{r}

# "starting on February 1 2020, we aggregate the total number of newly infected cases 
# in a given county over the previous 7 days (including the given day) 
# and calculate the daily average during this time period."

# I originally made this a function bc i was gonna apply it to all 3 
# covid datsets, but then I realized I should combine all 3 datasets
# and then run the function once, so the time is continuous 

create_daily_avg_by_week <- function(df, start_date){
    # convert fips to string and add leading 0 if needed 
    # (should be 5 char long)
    df$fips = as.character(df$fips)
    df$fips = str_pad(df$fips, width = 5, side = "left", pad = "0")
    
    # drop rows that have NA's for fips code
    df <- df[!is.na(df$fips), ]
    
    # Convert the date column to a Date object
    df$date <- as.Date(df$date, format = "%Y-%m-%d")

    # drop any rows that are recorded before start_date
    # retain rows recorded on start date
    df <- df %>% filter(date >= start_date) 

    # Create a week column that increases with every 7 days from the start date
    df$week <- as.integer(ceiling(as.numeric(df$date - start_date + 1) / 7))
    #df$week <- as.integer(ceiling((as.numeric(df$date - start_date)) / 7)) + 1

    # Group by FIPS code and week, then summarize cases
    daily_avg <- df %>% group_by(fips, week) %>%
        summarize(total_cases = sum(cases), 
            avg_daily_cases = sum(cases) / 7,
            total_deaths = sum(deaths),
            avg_daily_deaths = sum(deaths) / 7, 
            .groups = 'drop')
    
    daily_avg
}

# combine all into one dataset 
covid_raw = rbind(covid2020_raw, covid2021_raw, covid2022_raw)
start_date <- as.Date("2020-01-26")
covid_daily_avg <- create_daily_avg_by_week(covid_raw, start_date)
head(covid_daily_avg)
tail(covid_daily_avg)
covid_daily_avg
```
### Choosing appropriate time frame to investigate further
# maybe we should do this with avg_daily_cases per population??

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# Assuming your data frame is named covid_data and has the columns mentioned
# Group by week and then summarize the other columns
weekly_summary <- covid_daily_avg %>%
  group_by(week) %>%
  summarize(
    total_cases = sum(total_cases),
    total_deaths = sum(total_deaths),
    avg_daily_cases = sum(avg_daily_cases),
    avg_daily_deaths = sum(avg_daily_deaths)
  )

# View the summarized data
print(weekly_summary)

library(ggplot2)

# Plotting total cases and total deaths for each week
ggplot(weekly_summary, aes(x = week)) +
  geom_line(aes(y = total_cases, color = "Total Cases")) +
  #geom_line(aes(y = total_deaths, color = "Total Deaths")) +
  labs(y = "Count", title = "Weekly Total Cases and Deaths") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Total Cases" = "blue", "Total Deaths" = "red")) +
  theme_minimal()

```

### Clean Population Data (from USDA) 2020 - 2022

```{r}
population <- population_raw[-(1:3), ]

# Set the column names of to be the values of the first row
colnames(population) <- as.character(unlist(population[1, ]))
population <- population[-1, ]
# remove first row of data since it's for entirety of USA
population <- population[-1, ]

# extract population estimates
population <- population[, c("FIPStxt", "POP_ESTIMATE_2020", "POP_ESTIMATE_2021", "POP_ESTIMATE_2022")]
population[, 2:4] <- lapply(population[, 2:4], as.numeric)

# add average population 2020 - 2022 as we define socioeconomic factors as fixed 
population$avg_pop <- rowMeans(population[, 2:4], na.rm = TRUE)

head(population)
```


### Clean Education Data (from USDA) 2021

```{r}
education <- education_raw[-(1:2), ]

# Set the column names of to be the values of the first row
colnames(education) <- as.character(unlist(education[1, ]))
education <- education[-1, ]
# remove first row of data since it's for entirety of USA
education <- education[-1, ]
education <- education[, c("Federal Information Processing Standard (FIPS) Code", "Percent of adults with a high school diploma only, 2017-21", "Percent of adults with a bachelor's degree or higher, 2017-21")]
#education

head(education)
nrow(education)
```

### Merge "Covid Daily Averages" and "Population" to form "Average Daily Fraction of Population"

```{r}
# "We then convert this number to the average daily fraction of the population 
# in each county that was infected during this week 
# by dividing with the county population." 

covid_daily_avg_pop <- covid_daily_avg %>%

### Back to Cleaning covid data code

```
