### Clean Covid Data from 2020 - 2022

Format data according to "Spatial correlations in geographical spreading of COVID‐19 in the United States". 

```{r}
# are there any NA's?
print("NA count per column 2020")
print(sapply(covid2020_raw, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))
print("NA count per column 2021")
print(sapply(covid2021_raw, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))
print("NA count per column 2022")
print(sapply(covid2022_raw, function(x) sum(is.na(x))))
```

```{r}

# "starting on February 1 2020, we aggregate the total number of newly infected cases 
# in a given county over the previous 7 days (including the given day) 
# and calculate the daily average during this time period."

# I originally made this a function bc i was gonna apply it to all 3 
# covid datsets, but then I realized I should combine all 3 datasets
# and then run the function once, so the time in continuous

### Clean Population Data (from USDA) 2020 - 2022

```{r}

# Set the column names of to be the values of the first row
colnames(population) <- as.character(unlist(population[1, ]))

# add average population 2020 - 2022 as we define socioeconomic factors as fixed 
population$avg_pop <- rowMeans(population[, 2:4], na.rm = TRUE)

### Clean Unemployment Data (from USDA) 2020 - 2022 

```{r}

### Merge "Covid Daily Averages" and "Population" to form "Average Daily Fraction of Population"

```{r}
# "We then convert this number to the average daily fraction of the population 
# in each county that was infected during this week 
# by dividing with the county population."

           avg_daily_cases, avg_daily_deaths, avg_pop)

head(covid_daily_avg_pop)
```

```{r}
# counties with no population data 
fips_no_pop_data <- covid_daily_avg_pop %>%
  filter(is.na(avg_pop)) %>%
  pull(fips) %>%
  unique()
print(fips_no_pop_data)
```


```{r}
# "We remove 697 counties with a population less than 10,000 
# because a small change in the number of cases in a small population 
# can lead to large fluctuations, which results in a total of 2411 counties"

covid_fract_daily_avg <- covid_daily_avg_pop %>%
  # Remove rows where avg_pop is less than 10000
  # or avg_pop is null
  filter(avg_pop >= 10000, !is.na(avg_pop)) %>%
  # divide by population
  mutate(fract_avg_daily_cases = avg_daily_cases / avg_pop,
         fract_avg_daily_deaths = avg_daily_deaths / avg_pop) %>%
  select(fips, week, total_cases, total_deaths, 
           fract_avg_daily_cases, fract_avg_daily_deaths, avg_pop)

head(covid_fract_daily_avg)

```

```{r}
# how many counties are there?
length(unique(covid_fract_daily_avg$fips))
# doesn't match with 2411 counties from paper 
```
